sectionring
===========

Generate SVG code for ring sections for laser cutting.

When cutting a ring/wheel/circle using a laser cutter or CNC mill there
is a lot of potential for wasting material, depending on how much empty space is inside the ring. This code is an effort to make the waste less by sectioning the ring up into smaller parts, which can be arranged afterwards, to take less space on the plate out of which they are cut.
